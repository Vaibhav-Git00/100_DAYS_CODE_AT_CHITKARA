____________________ARRAY____________________
-->Array: Data Structure which stores a collection of homogeneous items(of same type like: int, char, bool)
-->Represented as a block of memory divided into more blocks. Length of array = number of inside blocks
-->Index: Tells about location of every element in array (starts with 0)
-->Array Declaration: data_type array_name [arraysize]
-->Contiguous Memory Allocation: elements are stores in consecutive blocks of memory
-->Let address of 1st element = x
-->Address of 2nd element = x + Lengthofelement
-->Array Types: Single dimensional or 1-D array and Multidimensional array
-->Accessing elements in Single dimensional array: 0 based indexing
-->Index of last element = lengthofarray - 1


--> linear search- linear search is always work on when we finding value of particular index number.
--> BINARY SEARCH- binary search is always applied for sorted array, if they are in increasing order or decreasing order.
